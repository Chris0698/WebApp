KF6012 Web App submission.

Used OOPHP classes, they are inside server/classes directory. Webpage class was unused but i think all the others were including FileWriter class to log an exception to a text file for a fun little bonus thing. 

Inside testing for allow a note to be changed or created, for this implementation it will be to create a note for film ID 10. If you click on the view note link, that will show the note been created for ID 10. 

Slight change to the suggested directory structure, it was largely kept as recomended with some varitation. The  config file was created for the database connection was at root level. The database was kept inside server. If a new database is used, then add the new database into the directory of the current one and update the XML file. The CSS file was kept inside a CSS folder. 

Not much else i can say really. Stuck to the assignment spec and implemented everything requested.
